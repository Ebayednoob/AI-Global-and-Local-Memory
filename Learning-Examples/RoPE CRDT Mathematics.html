                <h2>1. The RoPE Intuition</h2>
                <p>The fundamental motivation behind RoPE is that in many contexts, like language, the <strong>relative position</strong> of items is more important than their absolute position. RoPE encodes position into a vector's rotation, making the relationship between vectors dependent only on their relative distance.</p>
                <h3>Key Equations</h3>
                <p>The goal is to find a function $f(x, p)$ that applies positional information $p$ to a vector $x$ such that the inner product (similarity) between two such vectors only depends on their relative distance, $m-n$.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
                $$ \langle f(x_m, m), f(x_n, n) \rangle = g(x_m, x_n, m - n) $$
                <p><strong>RoPE's Solution (in 2D):</strong></p>
                <p>RoPE achieves this by treating the vectors as complex numbers and multiplying them by a rotational term based on their position.</p>
                $$ f(x, p) = x \cdot e^{i p \theta} $$
                <p>Here, $e^{i p \theta}$ is a complex number representing a rotation by angle $p \cdot \theta$ on the complex plane.</p>
                <p><strong>Resulting Inner Product:</strong></p>
                <p>The inner product between two RoPE-encoded vectors, $v_m$ at position $m$ and $v_n$ at position $n$, simplifies beautifully. The dot product is equivalent to the real part of the multiplication of one vector with the conjugate of the other.</p>
                $$ \langle v_m, v_n \rangle = \Re( (v_m)(v_n)^* ) = \Re( (x_m e^{im\theta}) (x_n e^{in\theta})^* ) $$
                $$ = \Re( x_m x_n^* e^{im\theta} e^{-in\theta} ) = \Re( x_m x_n^* e^{i(m-n)\theta} ) $$
                <p>If we assume the base vectors are simple real numbers (like in the visualization, where they are `[1,0]`), this simplifies to the cosine of the angle difference:</p>
                $$ \langle v_m, v_n \rangle = \cos((m-n)\theta) $$
                <p>This proves that the similarity depends only on the relative distance `m-n`.</p>

                <h2>2. Visualizing RoPE Concepts</h2>
                <h3>Phase 1: 2D Rotation</h3>
                <p>As derived above, the inner product between two vectors rotated by RoPE is calculated as the dot product:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vector for position $m$: $v_m = [\cos(m\theta), \sin(m\theta)]$</li>
                    <li>Vector for position $n$: $v_n = [\cos(n\theta), \sin(n\theta)]$</li>
                </ul>
                $$ \langle v_m, v_n \rangle = \cos(m\theta)\cos(n\theta) + \sin(m\theta)\sin(n\theta) $$
                <p>Using the trigonometric identity $\cos(A - B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) + \sin(A)\sin(B)$, this simplifies to:</p>
                $$ \langle v_m, v_n \rangle = \cos(m\theta - n\theta) = \cos((m-n)\theta) $$

                <h3>Phase 2: 3D Rotation with Quaternions</h3>
                <p>To extend rotation to 3D, we use quaternions. A quaternion $q = w + xi + yj + zk$ can represent a rotation.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Vector as a Quaternion:</strong> A 3D vector $v = [v_x, v_y, v_z]$ is represented as a "pure" quaternion with a zero real part: $p = 0 + v_x i + v_y j + v_z k$.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rotation Quaternion:</strong> A rotation by angle $\alpha$ around a normalized axis $A = [a_x, a_y, a_z]$ is defined as:
                        $$ q_{rot} = \cos(\alpha/2) + (a_x i + a_y j + a_z k)\sin(\alpha/2) $$
                        In the visualization, the rotation is around the Z-axis, so $A = [0, 0, 1]$.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Applying Rotation:</strong> The rotated vector $p'$ is found with the formula:
                        $$ p' = q_{rot} \cdot p \cdot q_{rot}^{-1} $$
                        where $q_{rot}^{-1}$ is the conjugate (inverse) of $q_{rot}$.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Phase 3: Context Compression</h3>
                <p>We can use the extra dimensions of a 3D or higher-dimensional vector to encode `context`. The visualization shows how the Z-axis value is created from a weighted sum of parallel data streams.</p>
                $$ Z_{context} = \sum_{k} w_k \cdot \text{value}_k $$
                <p>This concept can be nested. A document's state can be the sum of its sections' states, and a section's state can be the sum of its paragraphs' states. This allows complex, hierarchical data to be represented and merged using simple, commutative vector addition at every level.</p>

                <h2>3. Applying RoPE Logic to CRDTs</h2>
                <p>The conceptual leap is to substitute <strong>position</strong> with <strong>time</strong>. The state of a distributed system can then be represented as the vector sum of all operations it has observed.</p>
                <h3>Phase 1: Theory</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single Operation Vector:</strong> An operation `op` with a `value` and `time` is converted into a vector:
                        $$ f(\text{op}) = \text{value} \cdot e^{i \cdot \text{time} \cdot \theta} $$
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Total State Vector:</strong> The state $S$ of a peer is the vector sum of all operations it has seen:
                        $$ S = \sum_{j} f(\text{op}_j) $$
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Phase 2: Interactive Merge</h3>
                <p>The visualization demonstrates how two peers, A and B, calculate their state and how those states merge.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>State A Calculation ($S_A$):</strong> State A has two operations, $op_{A1}$ and $op_{A2}$. Its state is the sum of their corresponding vectors, $v_{A1}$ and $v_{A2}$.
                        $$ S_A = v_{A1} + v_{A2} $$
                        Each vector is calculated as: $v = [\text{value} \cdot \cos(\text{time} \cdot \theta), \text{value} \cdot \sin(\text{time} \cdot \theta)]$
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>State B Calculation ($S_B$):</strong> The same logic applies to State B and its operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merged State ($S_{merged}$):</strong> Because vector addition is commutative and associative, the final merged state is simply the sum of the individual peer states. This guarantees convergence.
                        $$ S_{merged} = S_A + S_B $$
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. CRDT Simulation: Rotational State Merge</h2>
                <p>This simulation models a "Last-Write-Wins" CRDT. The global state is the sum of the single latest operation from each participating agent.</p>
                <h3>Phasor Diagram Mathematics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Agent's Vector ($v_i$):</strong> The vector for agent *i* is based on its latest operation's `value` and `time`:
                        $$ v_i = [\text{value}_i \cdot \cos(\text{time}_i \cdot \theta), \quad \text{value}_i \cdot \sin(\text{time}_i \cdot \theta)] $$
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Global State Vector ($S_{global}$):</strong> The final purple vector is the sum of the latest vector from all agents:
                        $$ S_{global} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{agents}} v_i $$
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Interference Graph Mathematics</h3>
                <p>This graph shows the same information in the form of waves.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Agent's Wave ($y_i(x)$):</strong> Each agent's latest operation is a sine wave where the `value` is the amplitude and the `time` creates a phase shift.
                        $$ y_i(x) = \text{value}_i \cdot \sin(k \cdot x + \text{time}_i \cdot \theta) $$
                        (Here, $k$ is a visual scaling constant).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Global State Wave ($y_{global}(x)$):</strong> The final purple wave is the sum of the individual agent waves.
                        $$ y_{global}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{agents}} y_i(x) $$
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This concludes the mathematical foundation of the tutorial, showing how rotary embeddings provide a robust and scalable method for creating convergent distributed systems.</p>
